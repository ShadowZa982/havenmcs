# 🤝 Contributing to Minecraft Server Website Template

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this Minecraft server website template as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## 🚀 Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## 🐛 Report bugs using GitHub's [issue tracker](../../issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](../../issues/new); it's that easy!

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## 💻 Development Setup

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start development server: `npm run dev`
4. Make your changes
5. Test your changes thoroughly
6. Run linting: `npm run lint`
7. Run type checking: `npm run type-check`

## 📝 Pull Request Process
